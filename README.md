# Android-To-Do-app
The To Do app allows users to create a To Do note and assign priority to the note create from 1-10. Users can change the priority anytime after the note is create and the To Do list will be automatically re-arranged automatically based on priority. The app features live update of data, which doesn't need the app to be shutdown and restart.
